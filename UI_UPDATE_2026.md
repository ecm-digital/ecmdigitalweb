# 2026 UI Update Summary

The UI has been modernized to a "2026 Future aesthetics" style. Changes include:

1.  **Animated Mesh Gradient Background**: Replaced static gradient with a dynamic, flowing mesh gradient for depth.
2.  **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Updated all cards (Services, Team, Testimonials, Contact) with a premium glass effect (lighter background, subtle borders, majestic glow on hover).
3.  **Modern Typography**: Larger, cleaner headings with gradient fills and text shadows.
4.  **Buttons**: Updated `.btn-cta` with an energetic gradient, skew effects, and intense hover states.
5.  **Navbar**: Enhanced glass blur and border for better separation.

All changes are pushed to GitHub. Deployment to Vercel/Production will reflect these changes immediately.
